ToDo:
=====

Add a 'depends on' feature so a job will not start until another has finished?
- Is that wise? Perhaps this should be dealt with outside the library.
- Use a 'job completed' delegate!																							Done.
- Not useful? Cannot enqueue new jobs in the job-completed event because the queue may be full causing deadlock (if all threads stall).
